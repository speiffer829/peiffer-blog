Ok so I'm a 30-something year old guy who has been working in the tech industry for over 6 years now. I've worked in a bit of everything but primarily **Front End Web Development**. I've worked with a variety of technologies and frameworks, but I've always had a soft spot for **JavaScript** and **Svelte**. I will **TRY** to keep this blog updated but we'll see. Like most developers, side projects have a bad habit of falling to the wayside.

## Why Now?

Ok so here's a weird one. I've been wanting to start a blog for a while now. The thing that finally made me decide to make this thing: **We Bought a House**. In doing so I was put in charge of doing research on all the appliances and whatnot that we needed to buy _(fridge, washer, dryer, etc.)_. No one wants to listen to all the cool stuff I found out about so I figured I'd write it down here so that maybe, just maybe, someone else might find it useful. On top of all that [Astro](https://astro.build) is a pretty cool static site generator that I wanted to try out. So here we are.

## What Still Needs to be Done?

A bunch probably. I slapped this thing together in a weekend and I'm sure there are a bunch of things that need to be fixed. I'm sure I'll get to them eventually. I'm not sure what the future holds for this blog but I'm sure it'll be fun. Really hoping for that sweet 100s accross the board Lighthouse score. I also need to figure out if I'm confindent enough to swear here. I want to swear here. I might swear here.

## What Will I Write About?

Nothing is out. Might write about Javascript signals one day and the next day I might write a review for our light switches. Who knows. Not I. There is also a none-zero chance I'll write 2 posts and never open this again.

## Do I know what I'm doing?

No.
